Project Title: Result-Server

In this project I am going to build a web application with the help of which the students registered for an exam can see their result after otp authentication 
throgh their registered mobile number followed by verification mail.
I am using flask framework of python and used twilio api to send sms to the registered students mobile no. and with sqlAlchemy I am establishing connection between my app and the database.
I have result data and all the details of students stored in my MySQL database.
